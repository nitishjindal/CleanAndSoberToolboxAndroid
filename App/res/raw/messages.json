In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.  AA is based on one “drunk” helping another.  AA was started when someone who wanted to stay sober knew he had better try to help another alcoholic or else he would pick up that first, fatal drink.  He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I’ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I’ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.

Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress.

I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure.

True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause.

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.

However, sometimes we don’t even wait for a response. “How are you?” has taken the place of “Hi.” It may be a good idea to break this little habit because some people may infer that you don’t care about them if you don’t even wait for a response to your inquiry. We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one’s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the “How are you?” inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a “How are you?” question with the word “Fine.” “Fine” is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings.  The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited.    In her classic book, “Peoplemaking,” Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he’s asked how he feels, he will answer, “Fine,” because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?” P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple “How are ya’” in our everyday affairs. However, at least wait a second for a response to your “How are ya’?” At least say it and try to care. This may make a positive difference in how it affects the other person.Asking \"how are you doing\" (and meaning it) can be applied to anyone with whom you want to improve a relationship. If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him “How Ya Doin’?”  The same is true for your wife of twenty years.  Spouses seem to spend so much of their daily conversations solving problems.  Perhaps just asking your spouse “How ya Doin?” without expecting any specific response will show your love.

The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O’Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called “Love Story.”   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, “Don’t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you’re sorry.”  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person’s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person’s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like “when I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I’m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.” Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person’s feelings - you’ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you’re sorry.

I consequently tend to stuff too much into one day.  I tend to create artificial deadlines.  I fear that if I don’t get everything done today, it’ll pile up and then I’ll be “under the gun.”   So, I make the mistake of creating an emergency due to my fear of putting myself under the gun later.  This occurs because I am overly conscious of the negative consequences of procrastination.Solution to problem 2: Regarding my fear that if I don’t do it now, it will never get done is also a bunch of hooey!  If it doesn’t get done today, tomorrow or the next day, then it’s because I either had something more remunerative to be done or I’m dead in which case it won’t matter.  I must also note that I used the word “FEAR” in stating my problem.  Anytime I use that word, I’ve got to wonder if this is a “boogie man” I’m creating or whether I really have anything to fear.  In recovery, the acronym for fear is False Evidence Appearing Real. Fear is illusory.  I must therefore ask myself, “What am I afraid of?” Again, prioritizing is the key to dealing with my fear of not getting everything done.Solution to problem 3: To schedule more time between meetings, I need to take into account human functions like driving time, running into somebody who may need a kind word, or even helping someone who may have a real emergency. I’ve got to remember that red lights happen too.  They weren’t just put there to make me angry and impede my way.  Everybody has to stop for them.  The bigger picture, of course, is we all have a right to move along with our lives and sometimes that means it is my turn to wait. Scheduling “in between time” gives me more time to make others feel better.  I’ve found that if I take a few minutes to “stop and smell” the roses, my mind relaxes.By living in the above simple solutions, I have eased a lot of the emergencies out of my life, and I have continued to be more productive too.  I’m easier on myself, and I achieve my goal more often because I’m easier on others.

Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.

The best way to eliminate hate is to forgive, and the best way to forgive is to literally pray for the health and welfare of the person we resent.“If you have a resentment you want to be free of, if you will pray for the person or the thing that you resent, you will be free.  If you will ask in prayer for everything you want for yourself to be given to them, you will be free.  Ask for their health, prosperity, their happiness, and you will be free.

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.

Feelings rarely make sense.  Don’t expect to understand or agree with the other person.  Don’t try to explain why you felt you were right at the time the other person felt wronged by you.

Someone may also be in denial after a period of sobriety, thinking that there is no longer a problem or that no problem really ever existed.
