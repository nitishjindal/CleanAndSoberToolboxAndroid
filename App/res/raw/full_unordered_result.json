Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.

In early recovery, staying sober is enough. Later, it may help improve relationships to let others explain to you how you can make amends to them. The best way to discover how is to humbly ask what is wrong. If you are fortunate enough to get an honest  answer, don’t argue.  Another’s feelings of being wronged do not need to make sense. Feelings rarely make sense.  Don’t expect to understand or agree with the other person.  Don’t try to explain why you felt you were right at the time the other person felt wronged by you.  Simply say “thank you for telling me.”  Remember the goal is to mend the relationship, (and the first step is to get the other person to express his or her feelings) not to be right or justified.Let’s assume you have a problem with your wife. After she tells you what you have done wrong and you have reinforced her for opening up, tell her that you are going to think carefully about what she said and see what you can do to change that wrong.  Since most things that happened in the past cannot be changed, you may have to tell her that you are now going to amend your behavior as best as you can so that it never happens again. You may think that what she perceives as wrong is something you both need a counselor to assist you in resolving.  At the very least, you now have something you can deal with because you have enabled the other person to let you know what you need to deal with to change the relationship.  Without such knowledge, no progress can be made.You’ll find that a reduction of your ego with a commensurate improvement in your attitude level is the key to finding out where you went wrong in a relationship.

This will help you regain trust and respect in your Higher Power's time.", "title": "Do Nice Little Things For Others"}, {"message": "\"Remember Love Means Saying You’re Sorry\"****When you are trying to understand rather than be understood, you are pushing yourself further away from a relapse. The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O’Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called “Love Story.”   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, “Don’t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you’re sorry.”  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person’s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person’s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like “when I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I’m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.” Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person’s feelings - you’ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you’re sorry.

I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.

Nothing counted but thoroughness and honesty.  When we were finished we considered it carefully. The first thing apparent was that this world and its people were often quite wrong.  To conclude that others were wrong was as far as most of us ever got.  The usual outcome was that people continued to wrong us and we stayed sore.  Sometimes it was remorse and then we were sore at ourselves.  But the more we fought and tried to have our own way, the worse matters got.  As in war, the victor only seemed to win.  Our moments of triumph were short-lived...It is plain that a life which includes deep resentment leads only to futility and unhappiness.  To the precise extent that we permit these, do we squander the hours that might have been worth while....We turned back to our list, for it held the key to the future...  We began to see that the world and its people really dominated us... We saw that these resentments must be mastered, but how?...This was our course: We realized that the people who wronged us were perhaps spiritually sick.  Though we did not like their symptoms and the way they disturbed us, they, like ourselves, were sick too.  We asked God to help us show them the same tolerance, pity, and patience that we would cheerfully grant a sick friend.  When a person offended we said to ourselves, ‘This is a sick man.  How can I be helpful to him?  God save me from being angry. Thy will be done.’...Referring to our list again.  Putting out of our minds the wrongs others had done, we resolutely looked for our own mistakes.  Where had we been selfish, dishonest, self-seeking and frightened?  Though a situation had not been entirely our fault, we tried to disregard the other person involved entirely.  Where were we to blame?  The inventory was ours, not the other man’s. When we saw our faults we listed them. We placed them before us in black and white.  We admitted our wrongs honestly and were willing to get these matters straight....”I was amazed at the relief I felt after I did this.  I was also amazed at how my resentments and fears were nothing that I should have been awfully embarrassed about.  I wish I had let go of my secrets earlier.If you are carrying around something that you feel is so depraved that you can’t tell someone, you are living a lonely existence.  Lighten up.

In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.

Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.
