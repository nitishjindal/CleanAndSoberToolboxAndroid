		"Every addict has two brains: a \"dirty brain\" and a \"clean brain.\" The \"dirty brain\" wants to drink, use, or someway act out which ultimately causes trouble. The \"clean brain\" wants to stay clean and sober and free from trouble. This app causes us to use our \"clean brain\" particularly when our \"dirty brain\" is threatening. It substitutes the threatening thought with a truthful, rescuing thought. It changes our perception of a situation from something distressful to something manageable and even positive. It does this with unprecedented ease and speed. The result of changing messages is feeling better, beating cravings, and staying sober."
